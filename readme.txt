Start from running `boot.sh`. This will install all required dependencies.
Then run `build.sh`. This will compile all the generated code.
Finally, run `start.sh`. This will start the service. The script will keep running until you kill it, and the service will stop.

Then you can access the interface under `http://localhost:5005/`.
